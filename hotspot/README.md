# WiFi hotspot setup

Blatantly copied from here: http://superuser.com/questions/748455/how-to-setup-access-point-wifi-hotspot-on-debian
then modified from here: https://frillip.com/using-your-raspberry-pi-3-as-a-wifi-access-point-with-hostapd/

Keep in mind this is currently setup to work with openvpn running, all hotspot
traffic is forwarded through the tun0 network interface.
